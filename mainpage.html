  <h3>How It All Started</h3>
 </div>

 <div class="story">
  <p>Ash, being the petrol head he is, attended a car show in June 2019. While roaming the event, admiring the sleek lines
  and engines, his eye caught sight of a striking Red Abarth 595 Turismo. Intrigued by the car — a 1.4L engine,
  front-wheel-drive, and all that good stuff — Ash couldn’t resist. But it wasn’t just the car that caught his attention; it
  was Georgia, the owner. So, being the confident (or maybe just slightly bold) guy he is, Ash followed her on Instagram.
  He figured it was only a matter of time before she’d follow him back. Spoiler: She didn’t.
  <br>
  <br>
  Not discouraged, a few days later Georgia posted on her story, revealing she was absolutely terrified of spiders,
  especially after spotting one in her room. Ash, ever the problem-solver, responded with a deadpan suggestion: "Just burn
  the house down. That way you’re sure the spider’s gone for good."
  <br>
  <br>
  This sparked an unexpected conversation, and so began the unlikely connection that would eventually turn into something
  more...</p>

   <h3>The First Meet</h3>
  </div>
 <div class="story2">

  <p>Fast forward 6 months, after Ash had been waiting patiently for a sign or a sign-up for coffee, Georgia finally agreed
  to meet him. They agreed on Costa for their first coffee date. But, of course, with Ash, nothing is ever quite as simple
  as it seems.
  <br>
  <br>
  As they walked up to the counter, the barista spotted Ash and immediately said, “Oh, I know you. You’re the guy who
  resuscitated the baby the other day!”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ash, completely confused, stared at him for a second. Georgia, equally puzzled, glanced between Ash and the barista,
  probably wondering if she was about to find out that her coffee date had some strange “baby-saving” past that she'd
  never been told about. Ash, still dumbfounded, shot back, “What the f*** are you talking about?”
  <br>
  <br>
  The barista, realizing his mistake (or maybe just panicking), sheepishly replied, “I’m just trying to wingman you!”
  <br>
  <br>
  Ash, not having any of it, shot back, “I don’t need your help. Just give me the two lattes, thanks!”
  <br>
  <br>
  At this point, Georgia was staring at him like she had just discovered he might be a bit of a loose cannon. Still, they
  grabbed their coffees, sat down, and the awkwardness soon faded into laughter.
  <br>
  <br>
  And that, in a nutshell, was their first meeting. A bit chaotic, a lot confusing, but with a lot of potential.
  </p>
 </div>
  
 <div class="sub3">
  <h3>The Rest Is History <br> (Well, Almost)</h3>
 </div>
 
 <div class="story3">
 
  <p>After that slightly bizarre start, things began to fall into place. Ash and Georgia kept in touch, shared more laughs,
  and soon realized they had a connection that went beyond just a love for cars and sarcasm. Though there was the small
  matter of telling Ash’s parents about Georgia, but that’s a story for another time (and probably another
  location—perhaps Dubai, if you're lucky enough to visit).
  <br>
  <br>
  What began with a random Instagram follow and a conversation about spiders turned into something more meaningful than
  either of them could’ve expected. Now, when they look back at that first awkward coffee date, they both laugh about it,
  knowing that sometimes, the most memorable beginnings are the ones that are a little unpredictable.
  <br>
  <br>
  And so, Ash & Georgia’s love story continued... one latte at a time.
